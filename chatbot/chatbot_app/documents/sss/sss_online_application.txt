Are you a Philippine Social Security System (SSS) member but don't have a My.SSS account yet? Better do it now to reap the benefits of this online service facility.

Know all about My.SSS and how to register as an SSS member online in this comprehensive guide.

What is a My.SSS account?
A My.SSS account allows you to use the My.SSS or SSS Member Portal,[1] the government agency's main online channel that enables registered members to conveniently and safely access SSS services and their social security records.

Is SSS registration free? Yes, My.SSS account registration and use of the SSS online portal are both free of charge.

To use this SSS online facility, all you need is a smartphone, laptop, or any device with an internet connection. That means you can transact with the SSS Portal anytime and anywhere without the hassle of going to a branch, standing in long lines, and waiting for hours on end.

Why Do I Need to Register for an SSS Online Account?

 

The SSS portal member registration is mainly for your convenience. Completing the SSS online registration process can save you a lot of time, energy, and stress because you can complete an SSS transaction in the comfort and safety of your home, even beyond office hours.

Also, the SSS is "gradually implementing mandatory online transactions," according to SSS President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Regino.[2] This makes it all the more important for members to know how to make an SSS online account.

Who Can Register for an Online Account?
The SSS encourages all members to complete their SSS online registration through the My.SSS Portal. You can sign up if you belong to any of the following member categories:

Employees with SSS coverage
Self-employed or voluntary members
Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs)
Unemployed spouses with at least one-month posted SSS contribution
Employers
How to Register as an SSS Member Online: A Step-by-Step Guide
Before you start the My.SSS online account registration process, make sure you're already an SSS memberâ€”you'll need your SSS number and at least one posted SSS contribution. 

What if you aren't a member yet? How to register as a new SSS member? The first step is to fill out the Personal Record/ Unified Multi-Purpose ID (UMID) Card Application Form (E-1/E-6)[3] online. 

Once you're done, here's how to create or open an SSS online account.

Step 1: Go to the SSS Online Registration Page
how to register sss member online - sss online registration page
Access the Member Portal (member.sss.gov.ph) and click Register below the SSS Member Login.

This will take you to the Online Member User ID Registration page that shows you eight options. Choose one piece of information you've previously registered in SSS.

Savings account number / UBP Quick Card / UMID â€“ ATM savings account number registered in SSS
Mobile number registered in SSS
UMID card
Employer ID number / Household employer ID number
Paid payment reference number / SBR No. / Payment receipt transaction number
Date of the last loan
Transaction number in your Personal Record/Unified Multi-Purpose ID (UMID) Application (E-1/E-6) (only for online SS Number applicants from December 10, 2020 onward)
Check number of any SSS monthly pension
Step 2: Provide the Required Information

Make sure to leave no required field blank or incorrectly filled out on the SSS registration form.

Next, choose your registration preference. Here's a guide if you're not sure which one to pick:

For pensioner-members:
Savings Account Number (where you receive your monthly pension)
Check Number (of any monthly pension)
For employed members: Employer ID Number (minus spaces and dashes between the numbers)
For voluntary members: Payment Reference Number or SBR
For those with existing loans: Date of Loan
For those who just applied for their SS number: Transaction Number
You can also complete your SSS online registration using your mobile number or UMID details.

Wondering how to register on SSS online without registration preference? Unfortunately, you need to complete this step to open an SSS account. Contact your employer or SSS if you're not sure how to proceed.

Some tips to keep in mind:

If your last name and/or given name exceeds the character limit, just use the format of your name on your SSS ID or UMID card. You may contact the SSS hotline (920-6446 to 55) if you don't have your ID card right now.
You can leave the Middle Name field blank if you don't have a middle name.
To input your date of birth, use the drop-down calendar to prevent an error in your SSS online registration.
If you've chosen UMID CARD in Step 1, the online form will ask for your UMID card pin code.
Don't have the pin code yet? You have to activate your UMID card first in the SSS information terminal at select SSS branches.
Don't forget to tick the CAPTCHA box at the bottom of the page and the small box next to I accept the Terms of Service.
When you're done, double-check all information. Click the Submit button. A short message will appear to confirm the successful submission of your enrollment for SSS online registration. Click OK.

Step 3: Check Your Email 
After you submit your online membership application, the SSS will validate your info against its records. If they match, you'll receive an email from web.notifications@sss.gov.ph after around half an hour. The message contains an activation link and your user ID.

Can't find the SSS email in your main inbox? If the email address you provided is not Yahoo Mail (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, etc.), check your Spam folder for a message from the SSS.

Step 4: Activate Your My.SSS Account
Done with all the steps on how to register as an SSS member online? Now you have to activate your SSS online account.

Once you receive the email from the SSS, click on the My.SSS account activation link. You need to activate your SSS account immediately or for up to five working days. Otherwise, the activation link will expire and you'll have to go through the whole SSS online account registration process again.

Click on the link, which will direct you to a page where you'll be required to create a password and re-type it to confirm it.

Be sure your password meets these requirements:

Eight to 20 alphanumeric numbers
The first character is an alphabet
No special characters
Must be different from your user ID
When you're done, click the Submit button. If the two passwords match, you'll be taken immediately to your activated account.

You'll see a system notice that uploading required documents is temporarily unavailable. Tap Next.

State that you'd like to know your SSS number and provide the following information and document/s.

Full name
Birth date
One primary ID (passport, driverâ€™s license, birth certificate, etc.) or two secondary IDs (Postal ID, company ID, etc.)
ðŸ‘‰ Visit the Nearest SSS Branch
You may also go to the nearest SSS branch. Of course, this might take more of your time and effort, but you'll be sure that someone from the SSS will attend to your request and that you'll get your SSS number immediately.

6. How can I update my mobile number on the SSS Member Portal?
You can change not just your mobile number but also other contact details (such as landline number, mailing address, and email address) through your SSS online account.[6] Here's how to do it:

Log in to your My.SSS account.
Under the Member Info menu, select Update Contact Info. 
Update and submit your mobile number and any other outdated or incorrect details.
Check your email and SMS inboxes for a notification message from the SSS. Click on the link in the message to confirm your request to update your contact information.
Wait for a notification from the SSS on the successful updating of your contact details. The updated info will take effect after two days after you've confirmed your request.
Note: The confirmation link will expire after three days, so you have to confirm your request as soon as possible to avoid having to update your mobile number online all over again.

Final Thoughts
Now that you know how to register as an SSS member online and use the SSS online portal, you can easily check your contributions, apply for loans, update your contact information, and perform other transactions.

Sometimes, SSS members who tried to register from the My.SSS Portal would receive an email message about their registration failure. It happens when the system finds inconsistencies in the submitted information versus the SSS records. It could also be that the required format isn't followed.

When your SSS online registration is unsuccessful, you may try doing it again using another registration option (refer to Step 1) or you can email SSS at onlineserviceassistance@sss.gov.ph for assistance.
