Though it's essentially just a piece of paper, the NBI clearance says a lot about your civil standing and reputation in society. As such, a lot of employers and organizations treat this document as a primary and often non-negotiable requirement. 

In the past, obtaining this valid ID automatically meant enduring the long queues at the issuing office. And if you weren’t lucky enough, you'd find yourself waiting for your turn from morning to afternoon. 

Fortunately, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has modernized its workflow by going digital. Its processes are now more hassle-free and efficient. 

Ready to start your NBI online registration? Don’t stress yourself in case the entire thing is new to you. Here's how to get an NBI clearance. 

What is an NBI Clearance?  
An NBI clearance is an official document issued by the NBI proving that you have not committed any criminal offense or infraction in the Philippines.

You can use this clearance for various purposes: 

Local employment - Before an employer completely accepts you as part of the organization, the HR team may look into your background to check if you’ve committed any serious criminal offense, hence this requirement. 
Foreign trips - Want to work abroad? To secure a work visa, you’ll be required to provide this document. 
Proof of identity - Some government agencies may honor your NBI clearance as proof of identity. You can use it to secure other documents or IDs, such as a driver’s license. Likewise, you can use it to correct errors in government-issued documents, such as your birth certificate.

The first step is the NBI online registration. For this, visit the NBI Clearance website at clearance.nbi.gov.ph.[1] On the homepage, you’ll be asked this question: DO YOU HAVE AN OLD NBI CLEARANCE ISSUED FROM 2014 TO PRESENT? Since it’s your first time applying, choose NO. 

Then proceed with the account registration. After double-checking your details, mark the box that says READ AND ACCEPT TERMS OF SERVICES, check the I’M NOT A ROBOT box, and then click SIGN UP.

Step 2: Log In to Your Account
After you’ve created your online NBI clearance account, sign in using the email address and password you provided during the creation of your account. 

Step 3: Fill Out the NBI Online Registration Form
On the Applicant Information page, you’ll find a form that needs to be completed. Key in your personal details carefully. After that, click the SAVE INFORMATION button, which you’ll find at the bottom of the page. 

A pop-up reminder will ask you to double-check your details. If you’re good with them, click SUBMIT.

Step 4: Apply for the NBI Clearance Online

Step 7: Pay the NBI Clearance Fee
The process of settling your NBI clearance fee will depend on your chosen payment option. For example, if you choose online banking, you’ll be directed to a separate banking portal where you’ll complete the transaction. For over-the-counter payments, you’ll receive a reference number.

How much is the NBI clearance fee? Currently, it costs ₱130. You’ll also need to pay an additional ₱30 for the system fee, for a total of ₱160.

On the day of your appointment, head to your chosen NBI branch with the complete requirements. Because you’ve filed your application online, you can go straight to the encoding station where you’ll have your biometrics and photograph taken.

Step 9: Wait for Your NBI Clearance
Your NBI clearance will be released to you in a few minutes as long as there’s no hit. A hit means that you have a namesake who might have a criminal record with the NBI. 

If you have a hit, the NBI will delay the issuance of the clearance. This will give them time to verify if the hit is actually yours or just your namesake's. You may be asked to return to the branch after a few days.
