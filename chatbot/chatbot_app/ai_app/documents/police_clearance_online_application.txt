How to Get Police Clearance Online
how to get police clearance online - national police clearance system
The PNP has an online system for processing police clearance in the Philippines. Launched in August 2018, the National Police Clearance System (NPCS) is an online service that enables Filipinos nationwide to get a police clearance in less than 10 minutes. You're still required to make a personal appearance at a police station, though, so they can capture your biometrics.

Before this online system was implemented, a walk-in police clearance application usually took 30 minutes to an hour. This web-based system speeds up the process of verifying an applicant's criminal records and biometric data, as the NPCS is connected to the PNP database.

So if you need to apply for a police clearance, use the police clearance online appointment system to take advantage of its convenience and efficiency. Here's how to get a police clearance online.

Step 1: Register for an Account via the National Police Clearance System
