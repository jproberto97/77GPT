how to get nbi clearance | Moneymax
Though it's essentially just a piece of paper, the NBI clearance says a lot about your civil standing and reputation in society. As such, a lot of employers and organizations treat this document as a primary and often non-negotiable requirement. 

In the past, obtaining this valid ID automatically meant enduring the long queues at the issuing office. And if you weren’t lucky enough, you'd find yourself waiting for your turn from morning to afternoon. 

Fortunately, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has modernized its workflow by going digital. Its processes are now more hassle-free and efficient. 

Ready to start your NBI online registration? Don’t stress yourself in case the entire thing is new to you. Here's how to get an NBI clearance. 

What is an NBI Clearance?  
An NBI clearance is an official document issued by the NBI proving that you have not committed any criminal offense or infraction in the Philippines.

You can use this clearance for various purposes: 

Local employment - Before an employer completely accepts you as part of the organization, the HR team may look into your background to check if you’ve committed any serious criminal offense, hence this requirement. 
Foreign trips - Want to work abroad? To secure a work visa, you’ll be required to provide this document. 
Proof of identity - Some government agencies may honor your NBI clearance as proof of identity. You can use it to secure other documents or IDs, such as a driver’s license. Likewise, you can use it to correct errors in government-issued documents, such as your birth certificate. 
What are the NBI Clearance Requirements?

Wondering what to bring when getting or applying for NBI clearance? You need only two valid government-issued IDs. Any of the following are accepted for NBI clearance applications:

Passport
PRC card
UMID
PSA-issued birth certificate
Voter’s ID
PhilHealth ID
TIN ID
Driver’s license
Postal ID
Senior Citizen ID
Police clearance
PWD ID
OFW ID
National ID
Marina ID
Seaman’s Book
Make sure to provide valid IDs that meet the following requirements:

Original copy (photocopies are not allowed)
In good condition
With a clear photo of the applicant
Not expired
Also, take note that IDs not issued by the government, such as company IDs and barangay clearance, are not accepted as valid IDs for NBI clearance processing.

Important note: What about NBI requirements for first-time job seekers? You’ll also need to submit a barangay certificate to avail of the waived fee for your application, under Republic Act 11261 or the First Time Jobseekers Assistance Act.[1]

A barangay certificate proves that you’re actually a first-time job seeker and that you’ve been living in your current address for at least six months. Remember that this document should state that you're a resident of the barangay for at least six months and a first-time job seeker. It also should have been issued within the last 12 months and

How to Get an NBI Clearance Online in the Philippines
Knowing how to get or apply for an NBI clearance for the first time can be quite confusing for beginners. But don’t worry! We’ve come up with an easy-to-understand guide pf the NBI clearance application process for you.

Step 1: Create Your NBI Account Online
how to get an nbi clearance - create account
The first step is the NBI online registration. For this, visit the NBI Clearance website at clearance.nbi.gov.ph.[1] On the homepage, you’ll be asked this question: DO YOU HAVE AN OLD NBI CLEARANCE ISSUED FROM 2014 TO PRESENT? Since it’s your first time applying, choose NO. 

Then proceed with the account registration. After double-checking your details, mark the box that says READ AND ACCEPT TERMS OF SERVICES, check the I’M NOT A ROBOT box, and then click SIGN UP.

Step 2: Log In to Your Account
After you’ve created your online NBI clearance account, sign in using the email address and password you provided during the creation of your account. 

Step 3: Fill Out the NBI Online Registration Form
On the Applicant Information page, you’ll find a form that needs to be completed. Key in your personal details carefully. After that, click the SAVE INFORMATION button, which you’ll find at the bottom of the page. 

A pop-up reminder will ask you to double-check your details. If you’re good with them, click SUBMIT.

Step 4: Apply for the NBI Clearance Online
After turning in your personal information, it’s time for the actual NBI clearance application process. On the upper right corner of the screen, you’ll find the APPLY FOR CLEARANCE button. Click it to start the process. 

A pop-up box will then prompt you to provide the types of IDs (and their numbers) that you’ll present on the day of your appointment. 

To proceed to the next page, click I AGREE. 

Step 5: Set Your NBI Clearance Appointment
You’ll be prompted to pick your preferred NBI clearance center. After choosing your preferred branch, you’ll then select the appointment date and time. Note that the blue boxes on the appointment calendar are the vacant slots. 

Important note: Decide on your appointment date carefully. Once you’ve paid the NBI clearance fee, you can no longer reschedule your appointment. Nevertheless, if you can’t make it on your appointment date and you’ve already made the payment, the NBI will give you a 15-day grace period to get your clearance at your nominated branch. 

Step 6: Select Your Payment Option
After you’ve booked your NBI clearance appointment online, you’ll be asked to choose a payment option for your NBI clearance fee.

Here are some of your options: 

Over-the-counter bank payment – Metrobank, Chinabank, LANDBANK, UnionBank, Security Bank, RCBC, etc.
Online bank payment – UnionBank, BPI, etc. 
Cash
ECPay 
7-Eleven
Visa/Mastercard
GCash
Maya
ShopeePay
DragonPay
After choosing your payment option, click PROCEED.

Step 7: Pay the NBI Clearance Fee
The process of settling your NBI clearance fee will depend on your chosen payment option. For example, if you choose online banking, you’ll be directed to a separate banking portal where you’ll complete the transaction. For over-the-counter payments, you’ll receive a reference number.

How much is the NBI clearance fee? Currently, it costs ₱130. You’ll also need to pay an additional ₱30 for the system fee, for a total of ₱160. 

Step 8: Go to the NBI Branch on Your Appointment Date 
On the day of your appointment, head to your chosen NBI branch with the complete requirements. Because you’ve filed your application online, you can go straight to the encoding station where you’ll have your biometrics and photograph taken.

Step 9: Wait for Your NBI Clearance
Your NBI clearance will be released to you in a few minutes as long as there’s no hit. A hit means that you have a namesake who might have a criminal record with the NBI. 

If you have a hit, the NBI will delay the issuance of the clearance. This will give them time to verify if the hit is actually yours or just your namesake's. You may be asked to return to the branch after a few days.

PhilHealth Online Registration Guide: How to Register as a New Member
Venus Zoleta
VENUS ZOLETA
Last updated March 23, 2023
philhealth online registration | Moneymax
The first step to getting universal health insurance coverage in the Philippines is to become a PhilHealth member. This involves going through a membership registration process on-site, which means going to a PhilHealth office, accomplishing forms, submitting the requirements, and being issued a PhilHealth number.

Although PhilHealth still processes membership registration manually, the government agency has made enrollment simpler through its online registration facility. Now, you can just complete the process over the internet at home. No lines, no hassle.

Want to register as a new member and get your PhilHealth number? Here's what new members need to know.

What is PhilHealth Online Registration?
The e-Registration and Amendment System (eRAS) is a PhilHealth online registration facility that enables Filipinos and foreign residents in the Philippines to enroll in the National Health Insurance Program and get a PhilHealth Identification Number (PIN).

PhilHealth's electronic registration system is an easier alternative to manual membership enrollment, eliminating the need to line up at a PhilHealth office. Online registration is very convenient, especially for those who live far from the closest PhilHealth branch and those who are currently based abroad.

Using the system is free for everyone who has access to a computer or mobile device and an internet connection.

What are the Requirements for a PhilHealth New Member?
Fortunately, the PhilHealth online registration has been made much easier. Now, it requires only a few things.

First, you need to have your active and valid email address. This is where PhilHealth will send you the confirmation, transaction number, and other relevant details regarding your online membership registration.

Second, you must also have a copy of your valid ID, so PhilHealth can verify your identity.

How Can I Apply for PhilHealth Online Registration in 2023?
philhealth online registration - how to register online

Can I register for PhilHealth membership online? You might wonder. As of this writing, PhilHealth has no dedicated page on its website for the enrolment of new members.

However, you can send your PhilHealth online registration application via email. Here's what you need to do:

Download and fill out the PhilHealth Member Registration Form (PMRF).[1] Acceptable file formats are PDF and JPEG.
Email your completed PMRF to actioncenter@philhealth.gov.ph. Attach a copy or photo of your valid ID. Follow this email subject format: Register<space>Name<space>City/Province/Region.
Wait for your PhilHealth number to be sent to your registered email address within three to five working days.

PhilHealth Online Registration for Existing Members
philhealth online registration - how to create member portal account

If you’re already an existing member, PhilHealth online registration means that you’re creating a Member Portal account on the PhilHealth website.

What Can I Do on the PhilHealth Portal?
When you have this online account, you can perform various transactions at home without having to visit a PhilHealth branch:

Access your PhilHealth membership records containing pertinent details such as your beneficiaries
View your posted contributions (Use this facility to see if your employer is actually remitting your contributions) 
View, download, and print your Member Data Record (MDR)
Pay contributions online (for self-paying members only)
How to Create a PhilHealth Member Portal Account
You’ll need only two things to register: your PhilHealth number and an active email address. Here are the PhilHealth Member Portal account enrollment steps:

Access the portal at memberinquiry.philhealth.gov.ph/member. If that doesn't work, try these steps:
Visit PhilHealth's official website at www.philhealth.gov.ph.
Next, click on Online Services.
Then click on Register/Log-in under “Member Portal.”
Click on Create Account.
The online PhilHealth registration form will appear. Provide your basic personal information, including PhilHealth Identification Number, name, address, email address, mobile number, and log-in credentials, among others.
After completing the CAPTCHA test, click the Create Account button.
Open your email and click on the verification link sent to you by PhilHealth. You’ll be directed to a page that says your PhilHealth account has been activated.
Enter your PIN and password to log in to your PhilHealth online account. On the Member Portal, you can view your personal information, employer information, list of dependents, and contributions.

 

PhilHealth Online Registration FAQs
It’s good to know that the PhilHealth online registration has been streamlined. Still, got some questions about it? Here are the things that you may want to check out:

1. Who should enroll as a new member?
Although you can use the traditional PhilHealth registration method, it's a lot better to register online (as long as the e-Registration system is working). It will save you time, money, and effort rather than going personally to a PhilHealth office to enroll as a new member.

3. Why is the PhilHealth E-Register site down? When can I use it again for online registration?
philhealth online registration - electronic registration system down

The PhilHealth Electronic Registration System (eregister.philhealth.gov.ph) has been "under maintenance" for the past few years. As of 2023, it still can't be used for online application.

PhilHealth has not provided any updates on when this electronic registration system will be restored. However, based on a Freedom of Information request,[4] PhilHealth actually has plans to implement an online member registration system (the PH Pass) and integrate benefit availment into this system by 2023.

In the meantime, you can apply for membership online by sending an accomplished PMRF to PhilHealth Action Center's email address.

4. How can I get a PhilHealth online appointment?
At present, PhilHealth doesn't implement an online appointment system. To register as a member, you either have to email your PMRF or visit the nearest PhilHealth office to apply for a PIN and ID. 

5. Does PhilHealth accept walk-in membership applications?
Yes. If you don't have an internet connection or haven't received your PIN after sending your registration application via email, you may instead apply for PhilHealth membership manually. Take note, though, that the process will depend on the type of your membership:

👉 PhilHealth Manual Registration Steps for New and Existing Employees
Generally, the employer processes the employee’s application. If you’re a new hire or an existing employee without a PhilHealth number yet, here are the things that you need to do:

Fill out two copies of the PMRF. Normally, the HR department issues it.
Submit the copies of PhilHealth registration form to HR.
HR will then process your application. If the registration is successful, HR will issue your Member Data Record (MDR) and PhilHealth ID.

👉 PhilHealth Manual Registration Steps for Informal Economy Members
Informal economy covers a wide range of members. Primarily, this includes Filipinos in the informal sector, such as market vendors, construction workers, street hawkers, and more. Self-earning individuals, such as freelancers, artists, doctors, engineers, businessmen, actors, actresses, and similar professions are also part of the informal economy.

Other informal economy members are migrant workers (whether documented or undocumented), Filipinos with dual citizenship, naturalized Filipino citizens, and foreigners working or residing in the Philippines.

If you fall under this membership category, here are the registration steps to take note of:

Head to any of the Local Health Insurance Offices (LHIO) of PhilHealth Express outlets nationwide.[5]
Fill out two copies of the PMRF.
Submit the registration forms to the LHIO or PhilHealth Express.
Await your MDR and PhilHealth ID card. Once you receive them, you can start paying your premium contribution using your PhilHealth ID number.
6. What is a PhilHealth number?
The PhilHealth Identification Number (PIN), or PhilHealth number for short, is a unique and lifetime 12-digit number assigned to every PhilHealth member upon membership registration. Required for all transactions with the government agency, the PhilHealth number is used for the identification and eligibility verification of members.

7. How can I apply for PhilHealth membership registration as a first-time jobseeker?
philhealth online registration - first time application

Need to get a PhilHealth number but you don't have a valid ID yet because you're a fresh graduate? You can easily apply for PhilHealth membership registration to get issued that all-important number. 

Under the First Time Jobseekers Assistance Act (Republic Act 11261), Filipinos applying for jobs for the first time simply have to present a barangay certificate stating that they're a first-time jobseeker to avail of government benefits, including those provided by PhilHealth.

Alternatively, once you're hired, your employer may register you with PhilHealth. Just submit your completed member registration form and a copy of your birth certificate or valid ID to your HR department.

8. How to know my PhilHealth number online?
To get your PhilHealth number online, you have to register as a new member first. When you've completed your procedure, you'll be issued your PhilHealth number through email.

9. I forgot my PhilHealth number. How can I retrieve it?
If you're an existing member and you lost your PhilHealth number, you may request it through the PhilHealth Action Center at (02) 8441-7442 or email (actioncenter@philhealth.gov.ph). For email, use this subject format: PIN VERIF<space>Name.

PhilHealth also has a Callback Channel that you can access through SMS. Just type PHIC callback PIN VERIF<space>Your mobile number or Metro Manila landline<dash>Details of your concern. And then send the message to 0917 898 7442.

A PhilHealth representative will call you during office hours on weekdays. However, PhilHealth usually receives an overwhelming volume of requests and may not get back to you. Unresponded requests expire after 48 hours.

If the above channels aren’t available, PhilHealth encourages its members to visit the nearest LHIO or PhilHealth Express branch. There, the staff will look up your number and give it to you. Just to be sure, bring valid IDs for identity verification.

10. How to get PhilHealth MDR form online?
Use the PhilHealth Member Portal to view or get a digital copy of your MDR. As mentioned, this online service also allows you to check the accuracy of your PhilHealth membership records and posted contributions.

Follow these steps to access your PhilHealth MDR online:

Go to memberinquiry.philhealth.gov.ph.
Enter your PhilHealth ID number, password, and CAPTCHA code.
The Member Information page will be displayed. Click the Print MDR button to view your MDR. If you want to save it as PDF or print a copy, simply click the printer icon on the upper right corner.
If you don't have an online account yet, check the "How to Create a PhilHealth Member Portal Account" section above for the steps. 

If you can't access the Member Inquiry page (which happens a lot lately due to downtimes), you can request a copy of your MDR at the nearest PhilHealth branch. Just present a valid ID for identity verification.


 

11. How do I contact PhilHealth for other questions about my online registration and PIN?
For more information, you may get in touch with PhilHealth through any of the following channels:

Callback channel: 0917 898 7442 (Just text "PHIC callback<space>Your mobile number or landline number in Metro Manila<space>Your question or concern
Email: actioncenter@philhealth.gov.ph
Facebook: /PhilHealthOffficial
Twitter: @teamphilhealth

Final Thoughts
With PhilHealth having multiple instances of website downtime this year, expect that your PhilHealth online registration might not happen when you need it. Just be patient and take the alternate route, which is to enroll manually at the nearest PhilHealth branch.

After all, the process is just easy with a few simple steps. The hardest part is waiting in line for about an hour. But you'll realize all the effort will be worth it when you or your dependent falls ill—the PhilHealth benefits you'll get will lighten the load on your wallet.

Last updated March 07, 2023
how to get police clearance online l Moneymax
If you're a fresh graduate who's just been hired or a new hire who just resigned from your old job, you need to secure a police clearance.

Thankfully, the Philippine National Police (PNP) offers a faster and more convenient way for Filipinos to secure this document. With an online application, you won't have to line up at the police station for more than an hour.

Keep reading to learn how to get police clearance online in the Philippines without any hassle.

What is Police Clearance?
The National Police Clearance is a document proving that the holder has no criminal or derogatory record based on the PNP database.

Police clearance is usually one of the requirements that job candidates must submit to their new employer. It's also accepted as a valid ID in the Philippines in some transactions, such as applications for national ID, NBI clearance, and credit cards.

However, the police clearance is not honored as a valid ID for COMELEC voter's registration and DFA passport application/renewal.

Police Clearance Requirements in the Philippines in 2023
How to get police clearance online and what are the requirements for police clearance this 2023? The PNP clearance requirements include two valid IDs. For police clearance online application, the valid IDs should meet the following criteria:

Not expired
Original (not photocopied)
Bears the applicant's complete name, clear photo, and signature
Present any two valid IDs when you apply for police clearance. In case you don't have one, you can present a Barangay Residency Certification.

Here are some of the accepted valid IDs. For the full list, visit the National Police Clearance website.

Alien Certificate of Registration
GSIS UMID
LTO driver's license
IBP ID
OFW ID
Passport
PhilHealth ID
Philippine Identification (Phil ID or national ID)
PNP ID
Postal ID
PRC license
School ID with registration form
Senior citizen ID
SSS ID/UMID
TIN ID
Voter's ID
If you have only one valid ID, the PNP will accept it as long as you can present a certified true copy of your birth certificate (with its original official receipt). Check out this birth certificate application guide.

How to Get Police Clearance Online
how to get police clearance online - national police clearance system
The PNP has an online system for processing police clearance in the Philippines. Launched in August 2018, the National Police Clearance System (NPCS) is an online service that enables Filipinos nationwide to get a police clearance in less than 10 minutes. You're still required to make a personal appearance at a police station, though, so they can capture your biometrics.

Before this online system was implemented, a walk-in police clearance application usually took 30 minutes to an hour. This web-based system speeds up the process of verifying an applicant's criminal records and biometric data, as the NPCS is connected to the PNP database.

So if you need to apply for a police clearance, use the police clearance online appointment system to take advantage of its convenience and efficiency. Here's how to get a police clearance online.

Step 1: Register for an Account via the National Police Clearance System
how to get police clearance online - register for an online account
To get your police clearance online registration started, visit the NCPS website (pnpclearance.ph).[1] For first-time applicants, click the Register button. Read the Terms and Conditions and check all the boxes to agree. Click the Next button to continue. When you reach the last page, click the I Agree button.

Provide the required information in the New Applicant Registration box. Make sure to provide an active email address. Then check the Terms and Conditions box and click the Register button.

You'll receive a confirmation message from the NPCS through email. Check your inbox or spam folder for a message with a link for verifying your online NPCS account. Click on the verification link. This action will take you to the log-in page of the NPCS website.

Step 2: Set an Online Appointment
Sign in to your online account by entering your registered email address and password. Click the Sign In button to continue.

Before setting an appointment for your police clearance application, you must edit your profile first. Click the Edit Profile button and fill out the online form with the necessary details. When you're done, click the Save Profile button.

To set an appointment, click the Clearance Application button and select the nearest police station where you'll get a police clearance. The list of available schedules will appear. Choose your preferred date and time (AM or PM). Then click Next.

Click the Land Bank of the Philippines button and then Save Appointment.

The police clearance online payment details will be displayed. Take note of the reference number issued by the system. You'll use the number for the police clearance fee payment.

Step 3: Pay for the Police Clearance Fee
Now that you have your reference number for your police clearance, you can now proceed to payment.

👉 How to Pay for Police Clearance via Landbank
Click the Pay to LANDBANK button, which will take you to the LBP ePayment Portal.[2] You'll then pay online through this portal using your account with LANDBANK, GCash, or BancNet.

👉 How to Pay for Police Clearance via GCash
For police clearance payments using GCash, just enter your GCash account number on the LBP ePayment portal.  Afterward, your transaction details and payment summary will be shown. This process is the same for LANDBANK and BancNet payment options.

👉 How to Pay Police Clearance via 7-Eleven
If you don't have a GCash or bank account, you can still pay for your police clearance via 7-11. To do so, just follow these steps:

Select Cash Payment on the LBP ePayment Portal and click Submit. For this payment option, the police clearance price would be ₱180 (₱150 for the police clearance + ₱30 convenience fee).
Select 7-Eleven as your payment channel, review the payment details, and click Proceed.
Copy and save your payment reference number and pay for it via 7-Eleven's CLiQQ mobile app. Take note that you need a CLiQQ account to proceed.
Select Government from the list of billers.
Choose MYEGPH from the list of options, then enter your payment reference number, mobile number, and total amount.
Click Confirm and head to the nearest 7-Eleven branch to pay for your police clearance by presenting the bar code on your CLiQQ app.
Step 4: Go to Your Selected Police Station
On your scheduled appointment, bring two valid IDs, your reference number, and the official receipt of your police clearance payment and present them to the police station. You'll then undergo biometrics (picture, fingerprints, and digital signature) capture. 
Your application will go through a verification process, during which the police officer will check your biometrics and criminal records on the PNP database. This process won't take long. Wait for your name to be called for the release of your police clearance.

However, if your application got a hit, you'll have to undergo another verification process. Once it's settled, you can claim your police clearance.

How to Get Police Clearance Online: FAQs

4. How to renew my police clearance?
There's no police clearance renewal in the Philippines. Once the police clearance validity period expires (after six months from release), you have to apply for a new police clearance through the NPCS. Just follow the same steps above.

Some tips to keep in mind:

If your last name and/or given name exceeds the character limit, just use the format of your name on your SSS ID or UMID card. You may contact the SSS hotline (920-6446 to 55) if you don't have your ID card right now.
You can leave the Middle Name field blank if you don't have a middle name.
To input your date of birth, use the drop-down calendar to prevent an error in your SSS online registration.
If you've chosen UMID CARD in Step 1, the online form will ask for your UMID card pin code.
Don't have the pin code yet? You have to activate your UMID card first in the SSS information terminal at select SSS branches.
Don't forget to tick the CAPTCHA box at the bottom of the page and the small box next to I accept the Terms of Service.
When you're done, double-check all information. Click the Submit button. A short message will appear to confirm the successful submission of your enrollment for SSS online registration. Click OK.

Step 3: Check Your Email 
After you submit your online membership application, the SSS will validate your info against its records. If they match, you'll receive an email from web.notifications@sss.gov.ph after around half an hour. The message contains an activation link and your user ID.

Can't find the SSS email in your main inbox? If the email address you provided is not Yahoo Mail (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, etc.), check your Spam folder for a message from the SSS.

Step 4: Activate Your My.SSS Account
Done with all the steps on how to register as an SSS member online? Now you have to activate your SSS online account.

Once you receive the email from the SSS, click on the My.SSS account activation link. You need to activate your SSS account immediately or for up to five working days. Otherwise, the activation link will expire and you'll have to go through the whole SSS online account registration process again.

Click on the link, which will direct you to a page where you'll be required to create a password and re-type it to confirm it.

Be sure your password meets these requirements:

Eight to 20 alphanumeric numbers
The first character is an alphabet
No special characters
Must be different from your user ID
When you're done, click the Submit button. If the two passwords match, you'll be taken immediately to your activated account.

2. How to do an SSS online registration using my mobile number?
Simply go to member.sss.gov.ph, click Register, and select Mobile number registered in SSS from among the given options. Then proceed with filling out the online form and completing the registration process.

Forgot your My.SSS user ID or password? Is your online SSS account locked? Here's how to recover your account and reset your password.

Go to member.sss.gov.ph/members/forgotPW.action.
Choose from two methods to retrieve your user ID or password: by registered email address or security questions.

5. How to get my SSS number?
Need to provide your SSS number but forgot your card? Or maybe you lost it? Don't stress yourself out. Here are four ways to get your SSS number.

👉 Call the SSS Hotline
The SSS call center hotline is open 24 hours, Monday to Friday (except during holidays). You may call the SSS at (02) 8920-6446 to 55. If this hotline is unavailable, you may try calling the SSS hotline number 81455 (if you're calling through a landline phone) or 1455 (if you're calling through a mobile phone).

An SSS representative will accommodate you and will ask a couple of verification questions before helping you retrieve your SSS number.

👉 Get Your SSS Number Online
You can view your SSS number after successfully creating a My.SSS account. Just go to the Member Info tab and click on Member Details. 

If you're not yet an SSS member and are applying for your Social Security number, you can do so by using the enhanced online application for an SSS number. Instead of visiting an SSS office and submitting your documents via the drop box system, you can simply upload your documents, such as your PSA birth or marriage certificate.

Aside from applying for your SSS number, you'll also be emailed instructions on registering for My.SSS.

How to Get an SSS Number Online
Accomplish the online Registrant Record Verification form,[4] tick the security boxes, and click Submit.
Click the link in your registered email to continue with your SS number application (the link is only valid for 5 days).
Enter all the required information and click Generate SS Number. You'll be able to view your SS number and print the form. But there will be PDF copies emailed to you as well.
Check your email for the My.SSS activation link and the list of supporting documents for your Social Security number.
How to Get Your SSS Number via the SSS Mobile App



Download and install the SSS mobile app from the Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or Huawei AppGallery.[5]
Launch the app and then tap No SSS number yet? Apply Now!
Read the guidelines and then tap Start to proceed with your SS number application.
Key in the required information and then tap Next.
You'll receive a six-character code in your assigned email address (also check your spam folder). This code is valid only for five days. Once it expires you need to submit another application. Key in the code and then tap Verify Code.
Continue with the SSS mobile registration process and supply all the required personal information.
Choose the purpose of your application. You also have the option to include additional beneficiaries (just tap Add Other Beneficiary and then key in the required information).
Review all the information that you've entered and then tap Generate SS Number.
You'll see a system notice that uploading required documents is temporarily unavailable. Tap Next.
Your SSS number and other information regarding your SS number application will be generated once the application is successfully completed. But a PDF copy of the Personal Record (E-/E-6), Transaction Number slip, and SS number slip will be made available for filing or printing out for future reference.
You'll then receive two emails: a confirmation email of your online SS number application and another containing your password set-up for your My.SSS account.
To activate your My.SSS account, click on the link in the email, then key in the last six digits of your CRN/SSS number.
Click Submit, and then enter your preferred password.
Confirm your password and then click Submit.
Congratulations! You've now created your My.SSS account. You can now start uploading your supporting documents.
👉 Email the SSS Helpdesk
If the first two options didn't work, don't lose hope. You may send an email to member_relations@sss.gov.ph or onlineserviceassistance@sss.gov.ph.

State that you'd like to know your SSS number and provide the following information and document/s.

Full name
Birth date
One primary ID (passport, driver’s license, birth certificate, etc.) or two secondary IDs (Postal ID, company ID, etc.)
👉 Visit the Nearest SSS Branch
You may also go to the nearest SSS branch. Of course, this might take more of your time and effort, but you'll be sure that someone from the SSS will attend to your request and that you'll get your SSS number immediately.

6. How can I update my mobile number on the SSS Member Portal?
You can change not just your mobile number but also other contact details (such as landline number, mailing address, and email address) through your SSS online account.[6] Here's how to do it:

Log in to your My.SSS account.
Under the Member Info menu, select Update Contact Info. 
Update and submit your mobile number and any other outdated or incorrect details.
Check your email and SMS inboxes for a notification message from the SSS. Click on the link in the message to confirm your request to update your contact information.
Wait for a notification from the SSS on the successful updating of your contact details. The updated info will take effect after two days after you've confirmed your request.
Note: The confirmation link will expire after three days, so you have to confirm your request as soon as possible to avoid having to update your mobile number online all over again.

Final Thoughts
Now that you know how to register as an SSS member online and use the SSS online portal, you can easily check your contributions, apply for loans, update your contact information, and perform other transactions.

Sometimes, SSS members who tried to register from the My.SSS Portal would receive an email message about their registration failure. It happens when the system finds inconsistencies in the submitted information versus the SSS records. It could also be that the required format isn't followed.

When your SSS online registration is unsuccessful, you may try doing it again using another registration option (refer to Step 1) or you can email SSS at onlineserviceassistance@sss.gov.ph for assistance.

How to Apply for an SSS Salary Loan: A Step-by-Step Guide
Rouselle Isla
ROUSELLE ISLA
Last updated January 09, 2024
sss salary loan | Moneymax
Sometimes, life makes it necessary to get a loan—you might lose your job unexpectedly, need to work on home repairs after a typhoon, secure hospitalization for medical emergencies in the family, or set up a small business for much-needed additional income.

Fortunately, it's easy to get an SSS salary loan. Thanks to the Social Security System's developed online system, active members can enjoy a hassle-free and convenient SSS online registration process and a quicker salary loan processing time.

If you’re planning to apply for an SSS salary loan, this article will tell you everything you need to know.

What is the SSS Salary Loan?
The salary loan is a cash loan that the Social Security System (SSS) provides to qualified employed members and currently-paying voluntary members to help them meet their short-term financial needs.

💸 How Much is the SSS Salary Loan Interest Rate in 2024?
The SSS salary loan interest rate as of 2024 is 10% per annum, making it one of the loans with the lowest rates in the Philippines. It's computed based on diminishing principal balance, which means the interest will continue to be charged on the outstanding balance until the latter is fully paid.

Who Can Apply and How Much Can You Borrow?
sss salary loan - who can apply

Can I apply for an SSS salary loan? How much can I borrow? And how much is the first loan of SSS?

Find the answers to such questions, as well as the eligibility requirements below.

☑️ Up-to-date Monthly SSS Contributions and Payments
Members with at least 36 months of total contributions, six of which have been posted in the last 12 months (before the month of application) can apply for a loan amount equivalent to one month’s worth of salary.

You can also apply for a two-month salary loan if you have at least 72 months of posted contributions, six months of which have been posted in the last 12 months before the month of application.

If you‘re employed, your employer must maintain up-to-date loan remittances and monthly contributions. If you're an individually paying member (self-employed, land-based OFW, voluntary member, or non-working spouse), you need to meet an additional requirement: at least six posted monthly contributions under your present coverage or membership type before your month of application.[1]

Lastly, if you've availed of other loans, including housing loans from the government's Unified Home Lending Program (UHLP), you also need up-to-date payments.

☑️ Not Yet Availed of a Final Benefit
You can get a salary loan as long as you have not been granted yet any of these final SSS benefits: retirement, permanent disability, or death benefits.

☑️ Meets the Age Requirement
The salary loan is available for qualified member-borrowers who are below 65 years old at the time of application.

☑️ Not Disqualified by the SSS due to Fraud
You need to have a clean record (no disqualification by the SSS) to become eligible for the loan.

How to Apply for an SSS Loan Online in 2024
You might be wondering: "Can I apply for an SSS salary loan online?"

Yes, you can! Employed members can apply online via the SSS website. The application must be certified by the employer. Self-employed and voluntary members can either apply online or head to an SSS branch near their place of residence or business.

Step 1: Create a My.SSS Account
If you don’t want to visit an SSS branch, you can apply for a salary loan online via the My.SSS portal.[3]

Check out our guide on how to register in SSS online if you haven’t done so yet. Learn how to register for an account and how to fill out the SSS loan form, just to name a few.

Step 2: Enroll a Bank Account for Your SSS Salary Loan Disbursement
To learn how to enroll your bank account, check out this Disbursement Account Enrollment Module tutorial on YouTube.

 

📌 Proof of Account Ownership for Disbursement Account Enrollment Module (DAEM) 
The SSS now requires members applying for a loan to upload proof of account ownership when enrolling a disbursement account. This is to protect the My.SSS account from unauthorized transactions and to ensure that the loan proceeds will go to the SSS member who applied for the loan.[4]
For SSS salary loan disbursement through a bank account, you can upload any of the following: 
ATM card that shows the full account number, account holder’s name, and the issuing bank 
Bank certificate/statement 
Foreign remittance receipt
Photo or scanned copy of passbook
Screenshot of the online/mobile banking account
Validated deposit slip
Note: For disbursements through UMID-ATMs, bank accounts transferred from Sickness and Maternity Benefits Payment Module (SMBPB) to DAEM, and DBP Cash Padala via M Lhuillier, you don’t need to submit proof of account ownership. 
Step 3: File Your SSS Salary Loan Application Online
SSS Salary Loan - online application

Once you've registered in SSS online and enrolled your disbursement bank account, you can apply for a salary loan. Here's how:

Log in to your My.SSS account and click on E-Services > Loans > Apply For Salary Loan. Your loanable amount and local mailing address will be automatically displayed.
Select your desired loan amount. You may choose to borrow an amount lower than what is shown on the screen.
Select the disbursement account where you want to receive the loan proceeds.
Read the terms and conditions carefully. Tick the box for I agree to the Terms and Conditions before clicking Proceed.
View, download, or print the Loan Disclosure Statement. This document contains your monthly amortization schedule and loan interest. After viewing the statement, click on Proceed.
On the screen, you’ll see a notification message with your SSS salary loan application details. Keep a copy of your transaction number. Alternatively, refer to the message sent to your registered email address or in the notification inbox of your My.SSS account.

 

Meanwhile, OFW members can apply for a salary loan at SSS Foreign Representative Offices within their current area. If unavailable, OFWs can designate a representative in the Philippines to submit their application and the required documents above.

Once your salary loan is approved, you'll receive a text message from the SSS.

4. What Does "SSS Loan Application Has Been Granted" Mean?
If you see this message, it means that your salary loan has been approved. To check your SSS salary loan status, you can log in to your My.SSS account. Click on Inquiry and then Loan Info.

Here, you’ll see your SSS loan status and other loan details. You’ll also receive another notification via SMS if the loan proceeds have already been credited to your disbursement account.

5. How will I receive the loan proceeds?
The SSS disburses salary loan proceeds only to the member's enrolled disbursement bank account.

6. How to pay for my SSS loan?
Borrowers need to pay their salary loan in 24 monthly installments. The monthly amortization begins in the second month following the date of the loan. It’s due on or before the SSS salary loan payment deadline detailed below.

💸 Loan Payment Deadlines for Regular and Household Employers
 
If the 10th digit of the 13-digit ER/HR number ends in	Payment Deadline (following the applicable month)

In cases where the loan defaults, the unpaid amount will be deducted from the benefits claimed by the member:

Self-employed and voluntary members will have the amount deducted from their short-term benefits (Sickness/Maternity/Partial Disability).
In the case of member-borrower's death, total disability, or retirement under the Social Security Act, the amount, interest, and penalties will be deducted from the corresponding benefits.
Members with outstanding loans must also inform the agency via mail, email, or over the counter at the nearest SSS branch of any changes to address or employer. The notice should include the SSS number along with the member’s name and signature.

7. Where to pay for my SSS salary loan online?
If you want to know how to pay your SSS salary loan online, it’s just like paying for your SSS contributions. You’ll need the Payment Reference Number (PRN) for your loan so that your payments will be instantly transmitted and validated.

For individual members, you’ll receive your SSS loan PRN by email, SMS, or through your My.SSS account. You can also make a PRN loan inquiry over the counter at SSS branches or through e-Service Centers.

Once you receive your PRN, you can pay through the different accredited payment channels listed below:[6]
