Pag-IBIG Online Registration 2023 | Moneymax
For fresh college graduates and first-time employees, membership in the Pag-IBIG Fund (as well as PhilHealth and SSS) is like a rite of passage into adulthood. It marks your beginning as a full-fledged career professional.

Fortunately, you can now finish most government transactions, like Pag-IBIG membership registration, online. That means thereâ€™s no need to travel to the nearest Pag-IBIG office and wait in line to register as a member.

It takes only a few minutes and several clicks to enroll as a Pag-IBIG memberâ€”a lot faster and more convenient than manual registration. To make the process even easier, here's a simple guide to Pag-IBIG online registration this 2023.

What is Pag-IBIG Online Registration?
Pag-IBIG online registration refers to the process of enrolling yourself as a Pag-IBIG Fund member through the Pag-IBIG website. It involves submitting your information, generating your Memberâ€™s Data Form (MDF), and getting your Pag-IBIG Membership ID (MID) Number through its Online Membership Registration facility.

Note that the Pag-IBIG online registration system is intended only for those enrolling as new members.
